# Iris Flower Classification Flask App ðŸŒ¸

This repository contains a Flask-based web application for classifying Iris flowers into one of three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica**. The backend is powered by a PyTorch-trained neural network model.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: Users can input flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and get predictions instantly.
- **PyTorch Model Integration**: The app uses a pre-trained PyTorch model saved in `.pth` format.
- **Enhanced Web Design**: Includes a responsive and clean UI with HTML and CSS.

## Model Details

The Iris classification model is a PyTorch-based feedforward neural network with the following architecture:

- Input size: 4 (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
- Two hidden layers:
  - Hidden Layer 1: 32 neurons, ReLU activation
  - Hidden Layer 2: 16 neurons, ReLU activation, dropout (30%)
- Output size: 3 (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
- Output activation: Softmax

The model was trained on the Iris dataset using:
- Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
- Optimizer: Adam
- Training Epochs: 100

The final trained model is saved as `iris_model.pth`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- PyTorch

---

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling to:
1. Validate user inputs.
2. Catch server-side errors and display user-friendly messages.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for uploading CSV files for batch predictions.
- Dockerize the application for easier deployment.
- Extend the UI for better user experience.
